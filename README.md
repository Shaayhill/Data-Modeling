# Library Management System

## Overview

This project is a Library Management System designed to help libraries efficiently manage books, authors, and library branches. It includes a structured data model and sample SQL queries for common library operations.

## Data Model

The data model consists of three main entities:

- **Book:** Represents information about books available in the library.
  - Attributes: ISBN, Title, Publication Year, Availability, Branch ID, etc.
- **Author:** Contains details about authors of books.
  - Attributes: Author ID, First Name, Last Name, etc.
- **LibraryBranch:** Represents library branches where books are available.
  - Attributes: Branch ID, Branch Name, Location, etc.

Additionally, a junction table named "BookAuthor" is used to handle the many-to-many relationship between books and authors.

## SQL Queries

Sample SQL queries are provided for common library operations:

1. Find Books by Author: Retrieve books written by a specific author.
2. List Available Books in a Library Branch: Display books available at a particular library branch.
3. Count Books by Author: Count the number of books written by each author.
4. Add a New Book: Insert a new book's details into the database.
5. Update Book Availability: Update the availability status of a book (e.g., check-out, return).
6. Remove an Author's Books: Delete all books by a specific author from the database.

## Getting Started

1. **Database Setup:** Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create tables based on the provided data model.

2. **Data Population:** Populate the tables with sample data, including books, authors, and library branches.

3. **Query Execution:** Execute the sample SQL queries to perform library operations and test the system.
